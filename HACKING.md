# RequireJS Optimizer

Basketball GM uses the RequireJS optimizer to combine JavaScript files and
templates into one minified file. Installation instructions can be found here
http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#download (you should install through
npm). Then, just run:

      make build-requirejs

(Running  just `make` will run the RequireJS optimizer and minify CSS.)

Alternatively, to use the unminified uncombined JavaScript files, go to Tools >
Enable Debug Mode. This is quite useful during development, since it avoids the
need for any compile step



# Templates

Templates use Knockout for realtime updates.

As noted above, templates are compiled by the RequireJS Optimizer. If you want
to add a new template, you have to add a reference to it in js/templates.js.



# CSS

By default, a minified CSS file is used. This is done using YUI Compressor
(which is available in Ubuntu via `sudo apt-get install yui-compressor` - for
other OSes, Google for install instructions). To update the minified CSS file,
run:

    make build-css

(Running  just `make` will run the RequireJS optimizer and minify CSS.)

Alternatively, you can use the unminified CSS files by going to Tools > Enable
Debug Mode, which removes the need for any compile step during development.



# Adding a new page

...is kind of a bitch. You need to explicitly include the template file in
js/templates.js, and explicitly include the view in js/views.js. Beyond that,
my best guidance is to copy from an existing page and use that as a starting
point.



# Documentation

Code is documented as described in the Google Closure Compiler documentation:
<https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler>. Google
Closure Compiler itself isn't actually used for anything (yet). To update the
HTML-based documentation in the docs folder, install JsDoc Toolkit 2 (available
in the Ubuntu repos as `jsdoc-toolkit`) and then run `make docs`, which will
generate documentation and stick it in the docs folder.



# JavaScript coding style

Run ESLint with `make lint`

Documentation of functions is based on
https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler



# Twitter Bootstrap

Basketball GM currently uses Bootstrap 3.1.1 with the following options:

* @font-size-base set to 13px



# Basketball stuff

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.
For instance, "defensive rebounds" is "drb".



# To do on new version

- Make sure unit tests all pass
- (if necessary) Write database upgrade code in db.js
- (if not already done piecemeal) Write key changes in js/data/changes.js
- Set version in index.html, CHANGES.md, and README.md, like http://semver.org/
- Tag it in git like:

    git tag -a v3.0.0-beta.2 -m ''
    git push --tags



# Cordova

The game runs equally well within a web browser and within Cordova (Android
4.4+). The codebase is designed to handle both situations (the main difference
is absolute vs relative paths, governed by window.inCordova in index.html). To
collect the files needed for Cordova, run `make cordova` and look in the cordova
folder.
