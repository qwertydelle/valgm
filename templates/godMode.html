<h1>God Mode</h1>

<p>God Mode is a collection of customization features that allow you to kind of do whatever you want. If you enable God Mode, you get access to the following features (which show up in the game as <span class="god-mode god-mode-text">purple text</span>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create custom players by going to Tools > Create A Player</li>
  <li>Edit any player by going to their player page and clicking Edit Player</li>
  <li>Force any trade to be accepted by checking the Force Trade checkbox before proposing a trade</li>
  <li>Disable regional three player minimum.</li>
  <li>You can become the GM of another team at any time</li>
  <li>You will never be fired!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Some custom roster have much higher rated players. In order to improve performance with those you can also make player rating matter much more by going to Tools > Custom Roster Mode</li>  
  <li>You can also use this mode for normal randomly generated roster to make the game play a little more like actual Pro LOL. Currently LOL GM is a little more random in order to make the game more difficult.  </li>  
</ul>

<p>However, if you enable God Mode within a league, you will not get credit for any <a href="/account">Achievements</a>. This persists even if you disable God Mode. The only way to get Achievements is in a league where God Mode has never been enabled.</p>
