<h1>Export League</h1>

<p>Here you can export your entire league data to a single League File. A League File can serve many purposes. You can use it as a <b>backup</b>, to <b>copy a league from one computer to another</b>, or to use as the base for a <b>custom roster file</b> to share with others. Select as much or as little information as you want to export, since any missing information will be filled in with default values when it is used. <a href="http://basketball-gm.com/manual/customization/">Read the manual for more info.</a></p>
