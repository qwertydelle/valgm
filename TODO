Front End Developement
from AGlasgowThing sent 18 minutes ago
Hi,
I was just wondering if you are looking for any front end design/development for your GMLOL game as I would be keen to get involved.
AGT

r) latest champion meta (many on this, may want to make a user option **************** or fix old files?)

s) LCS ladder message off? 

Some feedback, I advanced from the lowest league to the LCS and every time I got a mail from the manager saying something like, @I hope we play in the CS or LCS soon@ even though I just advanced to that league and after that I got fired after coming 4th in my first season in the LCS, my 4th total season in the team, feels a bit odd?

t) finances

Im liking it so far, its pretty entertaining.
My only complaint is about the finances. In my team finances i can see all the income i have from streams, wins, etc and that is great. But maybe you could improve a bit the format. For example, if i hover the mouse i can see i have 180.0K cash, but i am spending 1231423 (some random numbers) in salaries. That difference in formats make it a bit harder to understand what is going on

w) More beginner friendly
This game looks pretty awesome! I, myself, am extremely confused by it - not really knowing where I should start, what stats matter more, etc. and I'm the kind of person who likes being given that information so it's not entirely for me, however maybe if I had access to that information or if it was a bit more beginner-friendly I could definitely see myself interested.

x) Watch list bug:
Just tried it! I enjoyed it a lot I binge played like 3 hours! I noticed there's some funky stuff happening on the watch list. I list a player on the future talent page and when season ends, after re-contract with current players my watch list become empty. Which can be fixed by going listing another player on watch list. Not so sure if it was a bug..

Happened in CHrome

y) Debugging - sent to Basketball GM

z)Full Korean team in wrong region.

aa) bans in game logo

ab) gold changes
Just someting weird that maybe you can fix,when watching the live game it seems the gold lead is a bit unrealistic at times,when doing it in one of my games the oposing team literaly got 20k gold while my team got 1k(my team was 68k the oponent was at like 80 and ended at 101)i find this to be basicly impossible in any lcs game.

ac) stats for player champion picks

ad) let user do picks and bans (another person asked for this, getting a lot of feedback about this)

ae)

Do you want help with the design?
from Kalahal sent 31 minutes ago
Do you want help with the design?

ad) give money to trade for player

ae) can't baron or dragon within certain time period:

22:28 - FG - HugeHunter, Golems, and Question3 killed the Dragon Dragon (2-1)
22:21 - FG - HugeHunter, Golems, WrongFury, Stop9, and Question3 killed the Baron Baron (1-0)
Holy shit the ROTATIONS MAN

No problem man, Somehow the game does not think that it takes time to rotate between obj, most of the time you don't notice it but sometimes a dragon gets killed 10 sec later then a tower or in this case baron

af) what is he talking about:

from BilgeXA via /r/leagueoflegends sent 24 minutes ago
Half the page is just a giant (468x436), embedded, mime-encoded binary image of the old nexus model, displayed at 18x18 on the page. Someone who is this incompetent at web design cannot reasonably be expected to make good software, and for that reason, I don't have any interest in playing your presumably buggy and inept game.

ag) guide to winning:

from PM_ME_TITSorASS via /r/leagueoflegends sent an hour ago
in 10 years I was able to turn EL5 to a complete dynasty Won the 2022 season then since 2026 I have been to the finals every year and only not one it once and I just finished 2031 year. I've also managed to keep my top laner and jungler for 8 years and my Mid for 5 and I just keep rotating my bot lane ever 2nd year lol

mycoder[S] 1 point just now 
Nice job! This is a basic template to how to play the game.

ah) realism, comebacks to easy?

How do I lose in Game 5 of the LCS Finals, with a 5k Gold Lead? I feel like there's some issues with your sims. Reverse swept in the finals, and lose game 5 with a 5k lead? That's pretty unrealistic.

ai) better interface and easier gameplay

Way too complicated for the average costumer like me. Make the interface and the gameplay more user-friendly and I might give it a chance. 2/5

aj) short summary of players/team

I would add a little feature for short summeries so that I can be more lazy, like for my jungler my little bio is
AnOnGolemX The owner wants him out So far he's been alright, with an average KDA of 1.5/3/2.5 and a kill partisipation of 58%
And for my mid
RiseOftheGolem Our highest ranked player with the biggest room for improvment
I'm in the process of doing his stats, but you could make the game auto do that. Other than that make it so that the stat grids are expandable so they aren't just 3-5 letter abbreviations. It looks fun though!

ak)

runs slow

al) boostap improved?

No problem! I was really into front end web dev for a while and stumbled upon this design for bootstrap. It's based off of googles paper design and looks clean and kinda like android. It's super easy to implement and looks a lot better than stock bootstrap. Link
http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/#about

am) If I could make a suggestion do a tutorial mode please.

an) Cool. BTW When you are mousing over things in the "statistical feats" section, the "jungle/dragon/baron" all list "rebounds" instead of whatever. ****

ao)
Some features that you might want to consider implementing:
-The patch needs to have more information i.e sort by best/worst champions, Champions with the highest ban, sort by role etc.
-More information on other teams i.e champions most picked by the team and performance stats on these champions.

ap) Strategy ***

I won it all in my third season!
What worked for me is signing free agents with low current skill but high potential to long term contracts. I then traded them for good current players until I had 5 played in the high 70 to high 80 range. They swept the finals.


aq) Player Mood , perform better and stick around with team
Also maybe some way to motivate players to continue doing well, or do better. And maybe stick with the team after the season is over.

ar) Getting Fired Bugs ****
- doesn't let you stay with new team.

as) secondary ban ( need an enhanced ban page were you list from best to worst)

at) patch page, highlights important buffs and nerfs
EDIT: The patch could also be implemented under stats just for a read only option and under tools for editing. Every-time the patch note changes it could also highlight the important buffs/nerfs.

au) finance tab, list of profit loss and not just graphs

av) Chinese version

Hello I'm a Chinese LOL Community's editor,would you mind me sharing your game with my conmmunity?
from Wha1efall sent 46 minutes ago
Hello! I'm a Chinse LOL community's editor,and I love your game [LOL e-sports management game ],and I want to share your game with our community. I will translate the main features into chinese with text,because I don't understand code language LOL. If you have any questions please let me know! Happy new year!

aw) currency option (play in euros)

ax) game strategy

How does the Firing system work. I was fired from a 2-time LCS champion team, after I was fired this team won 5 more titles without changing anything. Then I get fed to a ladder team again, I do my usual tank the first season gut the roster and pick up high potential players throughout the season for next season. It usually takes me 2 seasons in the ladder then I climb straight to LCS. So first ladder team I get, takes me 2 seasons I finally get a really good roster, I get fired, then that team goes on to make the LCS and is now top 4 in LCS with exact same roster I made. New team, okay, I do the same strategy, somehow I don't make challenger series with a stacked roster in my second season, so third season, I get even more stacked, and make CS, and will without a doubt make LCS the following year, but I get fired! How can I get fired when I just won the Ladder with best record and really low player salaries.

If you get a good design, this thing can become really popular

bo) roster page, switch by location (upgrade)

bp) Coach Mode strats

Hey liking your LoL manage game! :) Quick question/suggestion i guess:
-Will there be options like Team Training as: 'Play x scrims each day' and 'Go to bootcamp'.
-What about some extra settings in team strats, like: Botlane take ignite, play aggresive option. Or 'Play safe untill jungler comes for gank'.
Fight for first dragon, fight for first baron, double tp bot when pushed back.
I think you get the gist :P Like some extra strats. Thanks for your time!

cw) HOF factors in awards? Maybe awards length?

cx) Worlds, Break into a few segments (championship, regionals, etc)

cy) Remove Overalls:

- game option, just Overall, 12 ratings, 50 ratings

cz) GM contract with expectations 3 years at first, then get an extension etc.

da) too many 90+ players after a few years that are very cheap.

db) more options on coaches and analysts.

dc) Coach Mode: 

- allow better defense of baron
- team strategy


dd) role ratings? probably not

de) role swap without god mode (let play in wrong role or switch roles)

df) expenses: be more specific about what the impact is

dg) analysts send pick/ban suggestions before games (good with Coach Mode)

dh) Roster spot for coaches (after coach mode is there)

di)Bench player streaming as well as game streaming revenue

dj) Player opinions - have a basic player moral system in place, teams with no communication, language barriers, or unbalanced rosters will be unhappy and email you, causing you to deal with the issues. Trading, benching streaming, winning, and training can help.

ec) fuzz lowers over time

ed) coaches eveluate players


On a slightly related note, because I'm thinking of other management games where the coach has a stat for how well he/she can judge a players ability and potential, do you see yourself working on implementing coaches in the game? I can imagine it would take a long time and a considerable amount of work, but I'm curious what you think of doing that. It would be a cool dynamic to add to the game and help managers shape their team philosophies/styles.

ef) new owner messages:

https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/7aa41l

eg) http://www.esportsearnings.com/games/164-league-of-legends/countries

use to calculate how many players, but also use earnings to calc how good those players are.

eh) bug for complex picks/bans, mainly with Support, always go first, but picks wrong champion

ei) YWT not consistent, throwing off region switching after 2 years (only with imported files? can't find with new leagues)

ej) keeping player in region more, maybe make pay up out of region?

ek) Loyalty trait. Also boost streaming revenue

el) better portraits, real person, portrait moves?, show movie of player?

em) jungle farm should only go to one player, not other players

en) cash in trades

eo) player salaries have millions in places

ep) menu says weeks and not days (should be weeks)
Once you finish the playoffs at the end of a season and are waiting for the games after you to be completed (if you didnt win the finals) it counts down from 100 weeks, declining one "week" for each game thats played when i think its supposed to say days?

eq)
Also the Dutch ones usually learn some German too since it's mandatory.

er) More champion attributes.

es) some good players for cheap, some really expensive

et) overall different in different pages for older players?

ew) ******** upload of champions list allows for adding of new champs, maybe in game sim account for this?
- then let people upload champion files of different lengths

ex)

ey)

ez)

When i try to continue, i receive this message: "Your team has less than the minimum number of players (6). You must add players (through free agency or trades) before continuing." I'm stuck there, since I'm not allowed to sign free agents or make trades at that moment of the season.
- happens before free agency?

**** Korean should have a higher rating (rated higher, plus salary makes for very expensive)


A1) I think it's more than around year 10 that frustrates me/diminishes the game the most. It's like I'm the only one putting out 85+ players. I might see like 2-5 everywhere when I have 5 on my team. All leagues work like copy cats. If other teams notice I'm putting $$$ into infrastructure they would be too cause they know that's what I'm doing consistently over them if they want to win. I see a few teams with a comparable profit pool. they just never invest it which is weird. You can even see in LOL right now people are heavily investing in that.
B2) It's more about the player with OVR higher. I don't have examples in front of me. But when I see an 80 ovr/pot mid laner that's 20-21 asking for 150 and then a 20 ovr/88 pot rookie asking for 135. there's no way the rookie should ask for roughly the same sal. for such a small future upside and low present value. Even now most high potential rookies go to Challenger first for 1-3 splits. There are a few exceptions, but the game treats the exceptions as the norm. This becomes even weirder in ladder too. when there's the threat of promotion/demotion where sometimes you need results now.
B3) I think this is wrong. It works that way for the Top end of the LCS. "Legacy" Teams like C9, TSM, etc who only have the smallest of %ages to be kicked (even tho there are players that just leave after a split or 2 Santorin/amazing come to mind even tho they had lots of potential). where they know they won't be relegated. But teams and players that take offers from mid/low-end teams want 1-year deals due to instability in income/a spot for the teams and relegation for players. I feel like the default should be 2 and then sway depending on conditions. League rosters are very volatile like every year there's always 2-4 teams that rework their entire roster per region.
B5) I think that's fine if the player attitude is green towards you, but if they are red but willing to negotiate I don't think they should instantly accept or ask for a retarded amount. Also negotiation with a player that REALLY wants to join, like a dark green, when negotiation. price should be able to go down. If you're a top tier team you can get players for less money that aren't in the top 3% of players, even then there is an example of this for top tier players in the NBA taking less money for a super team.

Finances: adjust based on hype, no static

MMR: make it more in line with OVR? make sure it moves right

Bugs:
-When I upload any custom game file the free agency pool is always NAN on the first year. The game won't go forward if I sign any FA even if I negotiate them to an actual salary.
